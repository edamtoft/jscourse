# Challenge: Day 6

For this challenge, you will take an existing "barebones" project and refactor / reimplement it using an javascript UI framework (each team will use a different one).

The "barebones" vanilla-js client app is in the client subfolder.

The server will be available today at http://edamtoft.ad.dealeron.com:8080, but the source code is in the server subfolder along with instructions for running it. 

The application is a very basic javascript chat server. It sucks in a lot of ways. Your mission is to make the client application not suck. The actual "requirements" of this project are pretty open ended, but here are some ideas for features:
* Add colors, gravatars, or some other way of identifying who said what in a conversation
* Make it pretty
* Add formatting features, such as /code and /quote in hipchat
* Format links in messages, and show images in links
* Make display options configurable

Try not to make changes to the server code until you have a working client app, but then feel free to mess around with the server as much as you want to make new features work.
